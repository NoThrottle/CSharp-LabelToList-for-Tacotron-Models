- In Audacity, you can label a part of the audio, and export the file with the label as the filename. This program converts those filenames to a list.txt of the files with the label on the transcription part.

**Other things you need**
1. Make sure you have .NET Framework 4.8 installed on your system. Click [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) to download it from  the official Microsoft Website.
2. If you want to modify the format of the list, you have to edit the code yourself and compile it. I've taken the liberty to clean up the code and put all the things you should edit in one place.
